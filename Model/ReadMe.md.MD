## **What I Had Done:** ##
* Reading the data in python
* Basic Exploration of data
* Cleaning the data and transforming it to be useful for basic analysis 
* Visual Data exploration
* Made Different ML Models

## **Libraries Needed:** ##
* pandas - To manipulate dataframes
* seaborn - To visualise data
* matplotlib - To visualise data
* Scikit-learn - To Import Classical ML Models

## **Model Conclusions:** ##
* Linear Regression Has a accuracy of 62.33%
* SVM has a accuracy of -0.94%
* Random Forest Regressor has a accuracy of 76.06%
* XGBoost Has a accuracy of 70.76%.
* So for our model Random Forest Regressor is the best for our model as it is having the highest accuracy among other Models we have made.
